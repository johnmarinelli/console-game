<h1>Very simple roguelike for *nix systems</h1>

<p>This is a really basic roguelike that uses C++11.  Past attacking, there's not much else to do - I really only started this project to experiment with a few concepts.  These are:</p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>QuadTrees</li>
	<li>Manipulating console output</li>
	<li>Random dungeon generation</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>You'll notice that there are no .cpp files other than main - this is just because I thought this project would be smaller than it is, so I didn't write any .cpp files.  I may fix this later and write a makefile.</p>

<p>If you want to run this, just run the compile.sh script and execute the file.</p>
